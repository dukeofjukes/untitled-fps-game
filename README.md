# Untitled FPS Game

A playground of sorts to learn Unity Engine and game development as a whole. Will update this README when I find it necessary to do so (basically once I have a playable build).

Complete Tasks:
- player controller
- a decent enemy AI with state machine in C#
- audio manager and some placeholder sound effects (using Bfxr)
- HUD (crosshair, hitmark, player health bar)

Future Tasks:
- level design and creation
- more enemy types
- textures
- more HUD elements as they come up
- reload/ammo mechanics
- bullet trail (or kickback, not sure what the correct terminology is)
